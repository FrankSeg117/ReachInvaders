## Student Notes
We have added:
- New sounds, as well as readjusted the current ones them for better quality (Better shooting, bombexplosion, loss of a life)
- New new png for the bomb, while also adding a cooldown for the bomb that displays on screen so the player cannot spam it. 
- New shield indicator on screen
- Readjusted game progression so scores do not climb up as fast as to have not a so short or too long of an experience.

BONUS:
-We have made a total converison of the game, with one of our favorite universes, Halo!
-Changed every enemy, boss, and player sprites, to fit with the theme.
-Changed menus, background images.
-Changed main songs, shot sounds for every enemy
-Player shot sounds for their respective ship.
-Also added a little easter egg in the main menu!
